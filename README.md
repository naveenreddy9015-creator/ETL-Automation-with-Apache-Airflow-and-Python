# ETL-Automation-with-Apache-Airflow-and-Python

Designed and implemented a fully automated ETL framework using Apache Airflow and Python, streamlining the extraction, transformation, and loading of data from multiple heterogeneous sources into a centralized data warehouse. This automation ensures accuracy, reliability, and consistency of data for analytical purposes.

Detailed Description:

What you did: Created Airflow DAGs to orchestrate complex ETL workflows, including extracting data from relational databases, flat files, and APIs; transforming datasets using Python scripts and SQL; and loading cleaned and structured data into target data warehouses.

How you did it: Defined modular Python callable tasks within Airflow, configured scheduling for periodic execution, and implemented comprehensive logging and error handling mechanisms. Integrated notifications for failures and implemented retry strategies to ensure robustness.

Use/Impact: This automation eliminates manual intervention, reduces the risk of human error, and ensures that analytics teams receive high-quality, timely data. It accelerates reporting cycles, supports scalable growth, and strengthens data governance practices.
